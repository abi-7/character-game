# Character Matching Game

<h3>Hey there!ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<p>
  This is a matching game using the Rick & Morty api (https://rickandmortyapi.com).
</br>
  When entering the game the user is displayed with a image of a random Rick & Morty character and a list of 4 random character names from the tv series (one of these names match the character in the image displayedðŸ˜†).
  </br>
  There is also a button for the user to generate a new charcter.
</p>
<p>
  The objective of the game is to pick 1 name from the 4 displayed, guessing which name matching with the charcter shown. The user will then recieve a simple try again or a success right match!
